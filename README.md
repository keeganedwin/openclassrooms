# My Favourites
My project after completing the  "Build Your First Web Pages With HTML and CSS" on Open Classrooms.

The assignment was to create a webpage named "My Favourite" with a list of 4 different categories. By the end of the course I had learnt basic HTML and CSS language:

- How to create ordered and unordered lists 
- Adding links to other pages
- How to use and add classes & ids
- Create diffferent states for the links
